#### Continuity Checkpoint:

## Advanced Continuity Techniques

### 1. Overlap Planning
Each segment should include:
- **1-second overlap zone** (0:07-0:08) that matches next segment's (0:00-0:01)
- **Motion vectors**: Direction and speed of any movement
- **Expression transitions**: Never cut mid-expression change
- **Gesture arcs**: Complete natural movement curves

### 2. Transition Types

#### Continuous Motion Transition:
- Character mid-gesture at cut
- Movement continues naturally
- No pause or reset

#### Matched Still Transition:
- Brief pause at natural point
- Exact position match
- Breathing rhythm maintained

#### Energy Match Transition:
- Emotional energy level consistent
- Voice enthusiasm carries through
- Body language flows

### 3. Voice Continuity Bridges
- Last word of segment energy matches first word of next
- Breath taken at segment end if needed at start of next
- Tone arc continues across cut

## Segment-Specific Guidelines

### Opening Segment (1):
- **Energy**: Start at 70%, build to 85%
- **Position**: Establish center frame presence
- **Hook**: First 2 seconds must capture attention
- **Setup**: Environment fully visible

### Middle Segments (2-3):
- **Energy**: Maintain 85-90%
- **Movement**: Most dynamic actions here
- **Product Focus**: Clear demonstrations
- **Transitions**: Smooth energy flow

### Closing Segment (Final):
- **Energy**: Peak at 95% for CTA
- **Position**: Strong, confident stance
- **Product**: Hero placement
- **Expression**: Memorable final look
