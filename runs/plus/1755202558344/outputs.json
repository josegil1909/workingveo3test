        "physical": "The character is a woman in her late twenties to early thirties, possessing a timeless and approachable appearance. Her facial features are soft yet defined, with high cheekbones that lend a gentle elegance to her face. Her eyes are a deep, expressive brown, framed by naturally arched eyebrows that convey a sense of warmth and intelligence. Her skin has a healthy, sun-kissed glow, hinting at an active lifestyle spent outdoors. Her hair is a rich chestnut brown, cascading in loose waves down to her shoulders, with a few strands occasionally catching the light, giving it a natural sheen. She maintains a balanced physique, indicative of someone who values both strength and flexibility, with a posture that exudes confidence and openness. Her smile is inviting, with a slight dimple on her left cheek that appears when she laughs, adding to her friendly demeanor. Her overall appearance is one of natural beauty, with minimal makeup that highlights her features rather than conceals them, allowing her genuine expressions to shine through. Her hands are expressive, with long fingers that move gracefully, whether gesturing during conversation or handling objects with care.",
        "clothing": "The character is dressed in a casual yet stylish outfit that reflects her practical and down-to-earth personality. She wears a soft, cream-colored knit sweater that provides warmth against the cool morning air, its texture adding a cozy element to her appearance. Paired with this is a pair of well-fitted, dark denim jeans that allow for ease of movement, their classic cut complementing her figure without being restrictive. Her footwear consists of sturdy, brown leather ankle boots, which are both fashionable and functional, suitable for the varied terrain around her off-grid home. A lightweight, olive green utility jacket is draped over her shoulders, its multiple pockets hinting at her readiness for any task or adventure that might arise. Her accessories are minimal yet thoughtful, including a simple silver watch on her left wrist and small, stud earrings that catch the light subtly. This ensemble is completed with a knitted beanie in a muted earth tone, keeping her warm and adding a touch of personality to her look.",
        "current_state": "Her expression is focused and engaged as she speaks about energy efficiency. Her energy level is steady at 80%, conveying confidence and a sense of purpose. She stands with a slight forward lean, emphasizing her commitment to the message she's delivering. Her eyes are bright and attentive, occasionally glancing towards the solar panels as she gestures with her hands to emphasize her points.",
        "voice_matching": "Her voice carries a neutral-American accent, characterized by clear enunciation and a warm, inviting tone. It is soothing and confident, with a friendly inflection that makes her words engaging and easy to follow.
